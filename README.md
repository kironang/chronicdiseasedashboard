# McLennan County Dashboard (Version 0.2.0, 2025-July-21)
Kiron created this public health dashboard for a Summer 2025 internship with the Waco-McLennan Public Health District. It relies on the R programming language and the Shiny application framework. It also features the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. 

This repository provides an organized system for visualizing common public health datasets. Although the current state of the repository showcases methods for McLennan County, the manual below contains instructions for simple transitions to other counties in the United States.

Kiron tested the code in this repository with version 4.5.1 of the R programming language. Additionally, Kiron compiled the data from several different online sources:
- https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/diabetesatlas-surveillance.html

# User Manual
Good morning! Thank you for choosing this repository as a solution for your dashboard needs. My name is Kiron, and I'll be providing you with some guidance on how to maximize your county dashboard experience. First, I'll address any questions about testing the dashboard on your own computer, and then, I'll focus on what to do if you want to deploy the dashboard to an online website.

I've added images where appropriate to improve your experience. Please let me know if anything is outdated, incorrect, or unhelpful by contacting me at kiron_ang1@baylor.edu. Finally, please keep in mind that I firmly support open source information; I encourage you to do the same by publishing your code and data publicly, or at least by mentioning this repository.

With introductions out of the way, we will now begin!

## How can I run the dashboard on my computer?
Please follow these instructions before deployment! In this section, not only do I provide instructions for local testing, but also I explain the data preparation needed to incorporate additional datasets.
