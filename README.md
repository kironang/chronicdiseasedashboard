# chronicdiseasedashboard
Kiron created this public health dashboard for a Summer 2025 internship with the Waco-McLennan Public Health District. It relies on the R programming language and the Shiny application framework. It also features the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

Kiron tested the code in this repository with version 4.5.1 of the R programming language. Additionally, Kiron compiled the data from several different online sources:
